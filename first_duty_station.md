# First Duty Station

This is the file you will contribute to! Below you will see a list of user names and first duty stations. Yes, we did think this over and sincerely believe that there will be no issue with OPSEC here, but if you have any concerns, please contact us at [info@milspousecoders.org](mailto:info@milspousecoders.org). However, if it is a concern and you still want to contribute, put what ever duty station you want. ;)

_When adding your username and duty station to the list, we ask that you add it somewhere in the middle, not the start or the end. Thank you!_
